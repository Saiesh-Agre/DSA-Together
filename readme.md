# DSA-Together

Name: Saiesh Agre
Branch and Year: Second Year, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science

Enthusiastic, curious and eager to learn, I am a SE student currently pursuing Bachelor's of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.
I was always interested in Software industry. My introduction to Python and my first GUI project in it, got me interested in pursuing this field.
I like to Sketch and also like to read(mostly biographies, favourite: Becoming Steve Jobs), though I'm not an avid reader.

Why DSA Commuity?
I think it is a great opportunity to learn DSA, and where everyone is in it together. DSA forms a really important base for my field, so it will help me a lot. Also I 
would like to help others with my knowledge and hope I can do that with the platform.
